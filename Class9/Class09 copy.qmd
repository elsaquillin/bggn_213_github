## The PDB database

```{r}
library(readr)

stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
Xray <- sum( stats$`X-ray`)
EM <- sum(stats$EM)
Total <- sum( stats$Total)

(Xray/Total)*100
(EM/Total)*100

((Xray+EM)/Total)*100

```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}

protein <- sum(stats[1, 2:(ncol(stats) - 1)])

protein/Total

```
> Make a bar plot overview.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(stats) + 
  aes(x = reorder(`Molecular Type`, -Total), y = Total, fill = `Molecular Type`) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Total structures by Molecular Type",
    x = "Molecular Type",
    y = "Number of Structures",
    fill = "Method")
```




> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are currently 2,406 hits for HIV-1 protease structures

## Visualizing structure data

The Mol* viewer is embedded in many bioinformatics website. The homepage is https://molstar.org/

I can insert any figure or image file using markadown format
